<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In a time of effort, suffering and grief such as this
country has never before known, it is well that we
should have frequent occasions for a review of the
position in which we stand for a strengthening of our
sinews to continue the struggle in the spirit of the high
and noble resolve which induced our participation in it.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
This week-end will be a solemn occasion; it will draw
together the religious bodies in a rare unity of thought
and action. If there be in these times any who think
themselves superior to the need of intercession and
prayer they are not to be envied. For these are the
days in which human values are changing and the folly
of human pride and the weakness of human strength
are brought home to men—the old-time wisdom of the
humble heart is vindicated once more. And so we take
advantage of the fact that we are again upon the threshold
of a New Year to ask that the blessings of our God
may still be poured upon us and those who, with us, are
striving to right the wrong and to make the world the
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page004">[pg 004]</span><a name="Pg004" id="Pg004" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
better and purer for our fight against injustice, barbarism
and slavery. We of this generation feel that we are so
ordering our actions—many of us so facing death—that
we may be able to say to future generations: <span class="tei tei-q">“God
hath sent me before you to prepare for you a permanence
on the earth and to save your lives by a great deliverance.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The land in which we live is overshadowed, its people
perplexed and exasperated by the fears and resentments
of a fierce and desperate War: and we must needs
strive for balance, both mental and moral, if we would not
be swallowed up in the morasses of hate and vengefulness.
Whilst we turn to our God for help in maintaining our
just cause, which we cannot doubt is indeed His cause,
we still must guard our actions and our thoughts, to
prevent the blotting out of the moral issues that are at
stake.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
It would be a wretched perversion of conscience to
require of any man, condonation of the infamous cruelties
and treacheries which have disgraced our foes during the
last two years. The best elements in us rise in irrepressible
repugnance before such pageants of wickedness
as have clothed the famous name of Wittenberg with
infamy and made the story of naval warfare a continuing
record of wanton crime. No man can think, without
shame, of the so-called civilisation and culture which
could palliate such perversions of justice as those recalled
by the fate of Nurse Cavell and Captain Fryatt.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Yet there are two considerations that may help us to
feel that the German people, so far from being truly
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page005">[pg 005]</span><a name="Pg005" id="Pg005" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
represented by the miscreants who have organised and
carried through the atrocities on land and on sea, are
wantonly misled and disgraced by them.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
History includes the record of similar horrors perpetrated
by other nations which nevertheless are justly
reckoned among the best human material. May we not
hope that the crimes of Germany in the twentieth century
provide no truer index to the national character than
did those of revolutionary France in the eighteenth?
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Psychology unites its testimony to that of History.
Civilised man stands as the latest link of a long chain
of advancement from aboriginal beasthood, and he
retains within himself the germ of all his earlier traits,
though these are increasingly suppressed and held in
check by higher habitudes. Civilisation represents an
elaborate system of auxiliary disciplines, designed to
stifle as far as may be the brute in man and to strengthen
the acquired qualities of justice, mercy and refinement.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
When some sudden catastrophe such as Revolution
or War befalls, there is always great danger that that
elaborate system of artificial auxiliaries to virtue will be
broken down and the beast let loose in unchecked
savagery. Unquestionably this gives the key to the
atrocities that stained the French Revolution: it probably
gives the key to the crimes of German warfare. It
certainly leads us to the contemplation of the horrors
from which we ourselves would be free—a contemplation
which helps to make our Day of Intercession one not
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page006">[pg 006]</span><a name="Pg006" id="Pg006" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
merely of prayer for victory and its material benefits,
but for the ennoblement of our minds and the purification
of our souls.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
The happenings of the past two weeks have led our
thoughts to the possibilities of peace and the consideration
of peace terms.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
May the peace, whenever it come, be worthy of the
conflict that it ends, a peace which enthrones justice in
the affairs of the world and banishes oppression.
May the final treaty include specific provision for the
trial and punishment of the men who have organised
and carried out the crimes of the war. So shall resentment
die, when it is realised that our victory is unstained
with injustice, and the German people themselves are
helped to return to the fellowship of civilised mankind.
Thus shall the nations now at war at last be bound
together by the ties of international goodwill. If we are
able to realise these high aims then God will indeed
<span class="tei tei-q">“have sent us to prepare a permanence on the earth
and to save lives by a great deliverance.”</span>
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How great is the debt we owe to those who are bearing
the brunt of the struggle—how deeply we realise our
dependence upon the manhood of this nation! We
cannot allow a day set apart for supplication to come
and go without more than a passing thought for those
who have sustained wounds or suffered hardship for the
maintenance of our integrity and our rights of existence
as a nation.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page007">[pg 007]</span><a name="Pg007" id="Pg007" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Many are the movements to which the War has
given rise, which aim at alleviating the ravages
of the combat. When we think that of the seven-and-a-half
million Belgians left in Belgium, more than three-and-a-half
millions are being fed by the free canteens or
receiving relief in some form from the charity provided
in the first place by the large-heartedness of the American
people, we shall understand something of the vastness
of some of the problems which arise only to be dealt with
by outside agencies. The gallant stand of a gallant
people is still continued both before and behind the
German lines, where the Belgians are as stubbornly
resistant to day as they were when their King drew his
sword and said: <span class="tei tei-q">“For us there can be no other answer.”</span>
And the passive resistance of the imprisoned millions in
Belgium to the compulsion and cajolery alike of their
would-be friend, the enemy, is a factor in the German
subduing process the world outside must appreciate.
But the Belgians are paying the price. Their resources
are diminishing day by day. The world's benevolence
is dwindling and they are facing an immediate future
wherein life's necessities will have to be defined in terms
of the irreducible minimum. The whole nation,
we are told, is growing so thin on the small ration that
can be provided, that wasting diseases, due to under-nutrition,
are increasing by leaps and bounds.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
These facts are here referred to, first and foremost,
that we may pay some tribute, if only in thought, to
these and our other brave allies who have suffered
loss incalculable, and in the second place to direct our
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page008">[pg 008]</span><a name="Pg008" id="Pg008" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
attention to our own more fortunate position and to
remind us that amid all the devastation, the War is
being commemorated by works of beneficence and
mercy, works intended to show our sympathy for
suffering and our gratitude to the God who is supporting
us through these terrible days.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
He is not a good man who fails to employ every
possible effort to supply the needs of those dependent
upon him in his own household. No less is he a
moral failure who does not lend himself to support
every noble effort for the succour of those bound to him
by the ties of religious faith, especially when suffering
has come upon them through their faithfulness. And
so no one could have any compunction in appealing to
you as was done a short time ago for your own brethren.
But we must not forget that he who builds a fence,
fences out more than he can fence in. Israel must be
faithful to his own, but his own includes not only the
members of Israel's faith, who have the first claim upon
him, but all the children of God, who are by the fact of
their human birth, his brethren; and to-day the
appeal is made to us on behalf of those to whom we have
to pay something we <em class="tei tei-emph"><span style="font-style: italic">owe</span></em>. The sick and wounded
of our soldiers and sailors have a claim we cannot ignore:
their misfortunes have been brought about by their
devotion to our country's cause. It is enough that they
must suffer for us: we must see that everything possible
is done to alleviate the pains they undergo. The Sick
and Wounded Fund asks for your help, and, as I know you,
I am sure you will give it with no unstinting hand.
</p>

<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page009">[pg 009]</span><a name="Pg009" id="Pg009" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
We think to day of our wounded, but we think also
of our dead. Men may be willing to die for one cause
in one age, and in another for what may seem a different
cause, but in the last analysis it will be found that that
for which human beings lay down their lives is always
what they regard as the Eternal Right.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
In every man created in the image of his God there is
this strange mystical susceptibility, this urge to lay all
he has upon the altar of the ideal that he feels has the
right to demand his uttermost. Nothing else so fully
demonstrates man's spiritual nature: it is the one great
fact that differentiates us from the brutes.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
On the one hand is man selfish, greedy, earth-bound,
false and sordid in his aims. On the other, at repeated
intervals, in great and solemn hours, comes this austere
appeal for all he has to give—and he promptly gives it,
joyously, willingly, without thought of reward, and
derives a greater satisfaction from that self-giving than
from all other kinds of gain together. It is deep,
mysterious, elusive, this stress of the spirit, but we all
know it unmistakably as all generations have known it.
There is nothing so strong in human nature as this
impulse to fling ourselves away at the bidding of we know
not what, the something that incarnates itself now in this
cause or objective and now in that, and makes us feel
וישלחני אלהים לפניכם לשום לכם שארית בארץ ולהחיות לכם לפליטה גדולה
<span class="tei tei-q">“God hath sent us
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page010">[pg 010]</span><a name="Pg010" id="Pg010" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
before you to prepare a permanence on the earth and to
save your lives by a great deliverance.”</span> There is
nothing so exalting within the totality of human experience
as the elevation of soul reached by the one who
willingly dies for the sake of the others.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
How many men of character and intellectual gifts,
how many thinkers, writers, artists, how many men
fitted to promote the prosperity of their country in
industry and commerce have we lost in the War! And
how many of the rank and file, men who were distinguished
for nothing in their lives so much as the manner of their
death! How much poorer the next generation will be!
To the memory of them all we give the grateful tribute
of saddened and chastened hearts: we remember them
all in our prayers, we recall their heroism as we rejoice
in their manhood and their glory. Never was a time
when so many of our best and noblest have gone from us
willingly because they have felt it to be their duty and
never was a time when their parents and dear ones have
shown such a noble example of uncomplaining patience
under a loss which to them was the greatest that any loss
could be. We may well feel proud not only of the sons
but of the parents that they have willingly given
their children and have borne their loss with dignity and
resignation, not repining and bewailing their dead, but
putting their hands to works of charity and helpfulness.
Let us who remain be worthy of those who have been
taken, worthy of the country that can rear such children.
They have revealed to us the soul of the nation, the soul
by which, far more than by its wealth or its prosperity
<span class="tei tei-pb" id="page011">[pg 011]</span><a name="Pg011" id="Pg011" class="tei tei-anchor"></a>
or its material strength, a nation lives: and while the
soul of England thus lives, England will maintain her
greatness.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
Let us remember our heroes who have made the
supreme sacrifice, not altogether with sorrow, but also
with a solemn thankfulness—to God who strengthened
them to play their part, to them for their simple example
of duty done. The memories of these, our heroes, will
for us and for those who come after shine as a holy
flame, a light that will burn for ever at the altar of
patriotism and of duty.
</p>

<p class="tei tei-p" style="margin-bottom: 1.00em">
And so we commend their souls, even as our own, to
the mercy of our God, looking to Him in all humility and
trust to vouchsafe us in His good time <span class="tei tei-q">“a permanence
on the earth and a saving of life by a great deliverance.”</span>
Amen.
